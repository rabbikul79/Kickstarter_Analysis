# Kickstarting with Excel
- A project to determine how different campaigns performs in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Purpose
- A project to determine the data driven result to launch a campaign for a play
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
1. Mejority of the successful campaign luanches during the May & June months. The ratio of of successful campaign is 2:1 over the failed ones.
2. After July the success rate starts to drop and during end of the year almost 1 out of every campaign fails.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Some of the data fileds conatined too much data which were not needed for research. Had to modify the the existing data.
## Results
* Campaign should be launched around May - June period. 
* The campaign goal should be kept within the 5k range to ensure higher possibility to make it a successful one 
### Limitations of this dataset
* Some of the data were not properly catagorized. Some of the data are out of range to make the dateset skewed.
### Other scope
* We could compare similar play in different countries success/ failed rate to figure out the favorate genre for that region and start campaign for those types of plays.
